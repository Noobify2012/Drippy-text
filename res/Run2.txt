Summary: This is a run of my dungeon model which demonstrates a player moving through a 4 row by 3 column non-
wrapping dungeon with level 0 interconnectivity, 50% of the caves have treasure, 50% of caves and tunnels have
arrows, and 1 Otyugh. The player traverses the dungeon and is eaten by the Otyugh in the final cave which ends
 the game.

Edits to this output: The only edits that I made to this output was to reduce the lengeth of the line of the 
final edges and just dropped them down to the next line.
