Summary: This is a run of my dungeon model which demonstrates a player moving through a 4 row by 3 column non-
wrapping dungeon with level 0 interconnectivity, 50% of the caves have treasure, 50% of caves and tunnels have
arrows, and 1 Otyugh. The player traverses the dungeon picking up both treasure and an arrow. The player also 
shoots and kills an Otyugh. The player finishes by reaching the final cave where the game ends. 

Edits to this output: The only edits that I made to this output was to reduce the lengeth of the line of the 
final edges and just dropped them down to the next line.
